## HTML deliverable

For this deliverable I built out the structure of my application using HTML.

- **HTML pages** - I have 4 HTML page that represent the ability to login/welcome page, surf the top shoes, shop all shoes and an about page to learn about tahe origin of BRS.
- **Links** - The login/welcome page automatically links to all pages and all pages are linked together. 
- **Text** - Each page has a header and there is an about page that describes everything we do at BRS.
- **Images** - images of the shoes on all pages to view.
- **Login** - Input box and submit button for login.
- **Database** - The prices indicate real fluxuating market prices (this is tbd and has not been implemented yet)


## CSS deliverable

For this deliverable I will style the project

- **Header, footer, and main content body** - I styled my site to look monochrome and be easily navigated throught the header menu.
- **Navigation elements** - used the header and flex spacing to create a good looking menu at the top. 
- **Responsive to window resizing** - My app looks great on all window sizes and devices. It uses flex to modify well to everything. 
- **Application text content** - Consistent fonts, aesthetically pleasing to look at the site with the colors.
- **Application images** - correctly displays images under text and corrects width and height mistakes. 

## JavaScript deliverable

- **login** - When you press enter or the login button it takes you to the market-place.
- **cart** - Adding and removing shoes from the cart
- **shoe logic** - Adding and removing shoes button is independent per shoe and cannot remove a shoe that is not in cart.

## Service deliverable
